#python does not have any varirable to like var,let or const 

#we can declare the variables like

x = 5
y = x

print(x,y)

#Casting
#If you want to specify the data type of a variable, this can be done with casting.

a = str(3)
b = int(3)
c = float(3)
print(a,b,c)

#Get the Type
#You can get the data type of a variable with the type() function.

print(type(a))
print(type(b))
print(type(c))
